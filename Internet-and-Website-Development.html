<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h2> <p>The World Wide Web, commonly abbreviated as WWW or simply shortened to the Web is the world’s leading software platform when it comes to the Internet. The Web allows its users to access everything available on the Internet whether that be websites, documents, or videos. To access these forms of media, a web browser is required. Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox retrieve information from a web server and transfer it onto a user’s device using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol also known as HTTP. If the web server doesn’t find the document requested, a 404 response is displayed. If you wish to learn more about the World Wide Web, click the video below.</p>

<h2>How is the World Wide Web different to the Internet?</h2> <p>Firstly, the Internet is a huge network that connects devices all around the world. With it, people can share and communicate information from anywhere. Sounds related to the World Wide Web doesn’t it? The important difference to note between the two is that the Web are the visible pages, whereas the Internet is the network of computers which the Web uses to function on. To put it in a real life context, it is like the Internet are the roads in a town and the World Wide Web are the buildings by the road.</p>

<h2>What is an intranet and how does it relate to the Internet?</h2> <p>An intranet is very closely related to the Internet in the sense they are both computer networks used to share content between users. The most significant difference between the two is that intranet is either local or restricted to an organisation whereas the Internet is available to everyone across the world. </p>

<h2>What is an internet protocol? Compare HTTP, TCP/IP, and FTP.</h2> <p>Simply put, an internet protocol is a set of rules used to govern the format of data sent over a computer network. Some examples of such internet protocols include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). HTTP is an application layer protocol for gathering resources such as HTML documents. You may recognise the HTTP acronym at the beginning of website addresses. TCP/IP is different to HTTP because TCP/IP tells the destination which application should receive the data. FTP is also different to the two previously mentioned because what FTP does is transfer serves files from a server to a client.</p>
